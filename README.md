# Usage

You can simply type "Splitwise Title Name Amount Percentage" in Alfred to add expense to your Splitwise account.

Title: The name of your spending.

Name: The person you are splitting money with.

Amount: The total amount of the expense.

Percentage: The total share that you own. E.g. If the amount is \$10, by typing 0.2 means that you should pay â€‹\$2 out of the $10. If didn't mention, the default value is to split in half (50%).![Screen Shot 2020-06-03 at 8.23.01 PM](./Screenshots/Screen Shot 2020-06-03 at 8.23.01 PM.png)
